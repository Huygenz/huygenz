# Bluemist Themes

I'm from Germany. I'm currently obsessed with #394551 ![394551](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2411715/124731324-6a414580-df12-11eb-8dca-6e0d272a9179.png)
. This is why I make themes.

## Bluemist for Firefox
A simple and flat Firefox theme. Get it here:
* **[Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/bluemist-for-firefox/)**
* **[GitHub](https://github.com/Huygenz/Bluemist-for-Firefox)**

## Bluemist for Brackets
Brackets is my editor to go and I like it when it integrates into my colorscheme.
This contains two seperate themes: One is a simple Brackets theme, the other one goes a bit further and changes the colors of Brackets UI itself. Get them here at GitHub:
* **[Bluemist for Brackets](https://github.com/Huygenz/Bluemist-for-Brackets)**
* **[BluemistUI for Brackets](https://github.com/Huygenz/Bluemist-UI-for-Brackets)**

## BlueNaut for Reddit (RES)
A fork of Naut for Reddit. Getting Naut to play nice with Reddit (RES). Changing Naut to fit my flat [Bluemist theme for Brackets](https://github.com/huygenz/brackets-bluemist).
It's still missing much stuff but if you want to give it a go, you can link RES to this Stylesheet.
