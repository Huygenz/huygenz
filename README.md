# Bluemist Themes

I'm currently obsessed with #394551. This is why I make themes.

## Bluemist for Firefox
A simple and flat Firefox theme. Get it here:
##### [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/bluemist-for-firefox/)
##### [GitHub](https://github.com/Huygenz/Bluemist-for-Firefox)

## Bluemist for Brackets
Brackets is my editor to go and I like it when it integrates into my colorscheme.
This contains of two seperate themes: One is a simple Brackets theme, the other one goes a bit further and changes the colors of Brackets UI itself. Get them here at GitHub:

## BlueNaut for RSS
Getting Naut to play nice with RES. Changing Naut to fit my flat [Bluemist theme for Brackets](https://github.com/huygenz/brackets-bluemist).
It's still missing much stuff but if you want to give it a go, you can link RES to this Stylesheet.
